# Texture Atlas

The texture atlas works by generating a large texture on the GPU, then transferring other textures onto it for later use.  The current size of the texture atlas is `256*256`, allowing for a total of `256` `16*16` images.  This will likely be raised later to allow for larger textures sizes.  

The atlas texture is generated by the constructor of the texture atlas, and is unique to that atlas.  Multiple atlases can be defined and are bound like any other texture class would be.  

To retrieve a texture from the atlas, a handle to the texture can be requested.  This contains normalised UV coordinates which can be added to a vertex buffer or something similar.  These should be mapped using the following formula:

```
void MapCoordinate(UVCoordinate &vc, AtlasTexture &aT) {
	vc.x *= at.width;
	vc.x += at.x;

	vc.y *= at.height;
	vc.y += at.y;
```

This formula ensure that coordinates that are `zero` will be correctly offset to the starting position, and coordinates that are `one` will be mapped to the starting position plus the relevant size (width/height).

The texture atlas loads textures internally, and does not require use of the texture class.  Textures handles are stored in an `unordered_map<std::string, TextureHandle>`.
